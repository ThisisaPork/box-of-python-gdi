# Hede full of beis

This is a story between me and my coding teacher(actually a physicist with phd who teachs coding in a "not that good" way(at least for me))  

Since I'm still learning to write novels, I let chatgpt helped a littie bit :)  


Alright, buckle up for the tale of my adventures in VPython class. Picture this: a room filled with aspiring coders, all eagerly awaiting to dive into the world of VPython. Our instructor, though, seemed determined to drain the excitement out of every line of code.

One fateful day, he threw us a curveball - "Pixel art time!" he declared. Now, most folks took the easy route, crafting your run-of-the-mill pixel masterpieces. But not me, oh no. I had a rebellious streak.

In a fit of defiance, I decided to jazz things up a bit. I figured, why not import some top-notch pixel art from the vast universe of textures? Well, the teacher wasn't having any of it. He shot me a look that could've melted the toughest lines of code.

Undeterred, I hatched a plan. Instead of sulking, I decided to show them what real pixel art looked like. But here's the twist - I'm not just a programmer; I'm a problem solver. So, naturally, I set out to create a masterpiece the lazy way - with a touch of automation magic.

As the lines of code danced on my screen, I couldn't help but smirk. My creation was coming to life, pixel by pixel, without breaking a sweat. The teacher, still fuming from my earlier stunt, shot me another disapproving glare. Little did he know, I was about to blow his mind with my automated pixel prowess.

And there you have it, my friend, the saga of how I turned a mundane VPython class into a rebellious masterpiece, one pixel at a time.
